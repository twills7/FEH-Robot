If this is your first time getting the code from github, follow these steps to get the initial code:

1.) Go to the Robot Code folder and click the file called "main v#.cpp"
2.) Check to make sure the description says that it works. If it doesn't work, go to the last version and repeat steps. 
2.) Copy the entire code and paste it into VS Code

If you are uploading code to the Github:

1.) Rather than deleting the last robot code, we will make multiple files rather than trying to use pull requests.
2.) Click into the Robot Code folder and click "Add File" -> "Create New File"
3.) Copy your code from VS Code and paste it into the text box.
4.) In the name box, name the code "main v2.cpp" (Replace the v2 with whatever the last version was to keep the naming scheme)
5.) Scroll to the bottom of the page, select "Commit directly to Main branch", type a description of what you changed/created, and then click "Commit New File"


Reminders:

Don't delete any files because we might lose progress if your code doesn't work.
Only put files in the Github if you are sure they work. 
If they don't work but you need to save it to Github, make sure to say that it doesn't work in the commit description.
Make sure to download the newest version of the code from Github everytime you start coding.
